        "question": "Why does Windows show a security warning when installing?",
        "answer": "TourlyAI is not yet code-signed with a commercial certificate, so Windows may block it. The easiest fix: (1) Right-click the .exe → Properties. (2) Check the 'Unblock' checkbox at the bottom → Apply. Then open the file normally. If SmartScreen still appears, click 'More info' → 'Run anyway'. The app is 100% safe — the full source code is available on GitHub for anyone to review."
